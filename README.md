# MetroPhoneLauncher 📱

MetroPhoneLauncher (MPL, MPLauncher) is an Android launcher designed to resemble Windows Phone 8. 🌟

🛸 This is MPL version 8.0. It is lightweight, but contains far fewer features and customization options. Use it on older devices.

MPL is still in development, but it already includes a range of features you might enjoy. Here’s what’s available so far:

    🎨 A design closely mimicking the original Windows Phone.
    
    🌀 Animations that are as similar as possible to Windows Phone animations (almost :) ).
    
    🌈 20 different colors to make your device unique and stylish.
    
    🌙 Light and dark themes to save battery life and protect your eyes at night.

    🔋 High performance will save your device's battery and resources
    
    🏠 A unique home screen — customize it to your liking. Resize tiles, move them, and more.
    
    ⚙️ Extensive customization options to perfect your launcher experience.
    
    🔄 Over-The-Air updates.
    
    🎨 Icon pack support to enhance your icons' appearance.
    
    🎨 Monet (Dynamic Colors) support.

And many more smaller features!

## Coming Soon:

    🌠 Live tiles.
    
    Maybe something else =)
