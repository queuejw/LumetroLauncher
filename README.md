# 🌻 Lumetro Launcher

Lumetro is an experimental project to create a launcher for Android™ . It is not
an attempt to completely recreate Windows® Phone, but it is based on its design and tries to make it
more user-friendly by adding new features and modifying existing ones.

> Development is temporarily suspended, unfortunately.

# ⚙️ Why experimental?

In my free time, I am learning to create Android applications, so this project is the result of my
hobby. I am not a professional developer, so this app may contain various issues, including
critical ones. The further development of Lumetro Launcher depends on my free time and my interest
in the
project.

# ✨ What's interesting?

- 20 standard accent colors + the option to choose any other color
- Light, dark theme
- Icon pack support
- Move the tiles as you like and resize them
